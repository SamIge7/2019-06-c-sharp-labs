# Game Project: Noughts and Crosses
This project was a game project to build a 2 player game and link it with a database, which allowed us to insert new data and update data in the database.

## Getting Started

###Instructions to play the game
To play the game, download the Game_Project_Noughts_And_Crosses folder, and if you are in Visual Studio, make the project the start up project and click start.
This should load up the title page, which shows the current leaderboard in terms of wins and losses.
From here you can enter both players name into their respective boxes, with Player 1 being X and Player 2 being O.
Click Begin to take you to the main game window.
As soon as it appears, the game has begun and Player 1 has the first click.
A winner will be shown by 3 green boxes in the winning line, and if it is a draw, all the boxes in the grid will go orange.
To start another game with the same players, just click anywhere in the grid aftet the game is done, and it will all clear and start another game.
To see your wins and losses on the leaderboard, you just close the game and reopen it again to see the title screen leaderboard updated.
